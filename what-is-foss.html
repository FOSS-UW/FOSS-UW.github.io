			<p>
				In the early days of computers, software was
				written mostly by academics, and much of it was freely
				distributed; software was seen then somewhat
				similarily to a math equation: a scientific
				discovery to be shared, explored and picked apart.
				Somewhere along the way, however, software began to
				be treated as a private technology, its inner workings
				obscured, and its use and reproduction constricted with 
				copyrights and limitations.

					Pythagorean theorem.

			<p>
				<b>Free and Open Source Software</b> (<b>FOSS</b>) is
				software that is both <b>Free</b> and <b>Open Source</b>;
				the two are related but distinct concepts.
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Free Software</b> is commonly described using the
				phrase, 'free as in speech, not beer'; it aims to put
				the user in control of their software and system, rather
				than the other way around. Richard Stallman, the founder
				of the free software movement, defines free software as
				being software that provides these <b>four essential freedoms</b>: 
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any
					purpose (<b>freedom 0</b>).
				</li>
				<li>
					The freedom to study how the program works, and change
					it so it does your computing as you wish (<b>freedom 1</b>).
					Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
				</li>
				<li>
					The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help
					others (<b>freedom 2</b>).
				</li>
				<li>
					The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions
					to others (<b>freedom 3</b>). By doing this you can give the whole
					community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the
					source code is also a precondition for this.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Any piece of software that offers these four freedoms is considered 
				<b>free</b>. Note that the definition of free software does not
				exclude commercial use; it's perfectly acceptable for the developers
				of a piece of free software to charge for their work.
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Open Source Software</b>, while often using the same licenses to
				distribute its software, is not usually motivated by the same philosophies.
				Making a piece of software open source carries huge benefits to the project's
				development process, including increased security and functionality, owing to the
				possibly enormous number of eyes that can read through its source code. Because
				of its effects on the success of a piece of software, many companies and
				corporations who do not uphold the freedom that free software embodies may still
				support open source.
			</p>
			<h2>Why should you care about Free and Open Source Software?</h2>
			<p>
				Our world is dominated by computers and software. Everyday, we become more and
				more dependent on software for work, entertainment, education and communication.
				This trend shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon.
				<br>
				<br>
				Ensuring then the software runnning our lives is
				transparent is of utmost importance. Using free and open source software
				gurantees us just that: it allows us to 'peek inside' that software, to make sure
				it's doing what we want, and <b><i>only</i></b> what we want. Most importantly, it means that
				<b><i>we</i></b> are in control of our software, our computers and our technology,
				no one else.
