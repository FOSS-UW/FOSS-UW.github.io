            <p>
                The <b>Free and Open Source Software Club</b> is a student
                organization at UW-Madison dedicated to inspiring and supporting
                interest in free and open source software and technology. Although
                the club is mostly CS focused, it is not required for you to be a 
                CS/ECE major to join, or for you to have any previous experience
                with free and open source software. All you need is an interest in
                learning more!
                <br>
                <br>
                In creating this club, we hope to develop a network of UW-Madison
                students who are passionate about both developing and using free
                and open source software. Encouraging the use of free and open source
                software is just as important as developing it. Taking the plunge
                and using software that you're not already familiar with can be difficult
                whe you're making the switch alone. At the Free and Open Source Software
                Club, we hope to provide a support network in order to make that
                transition an easier process.
            </p>
            <h2>Meetings</h2>
            <p>
                The Free and Open Source Software Club will meet at least four
                times a month. Three of these will be <b>general club meetings</b>,
                where members are encouraged to come and socialize, talk about FOSS,
                and any projects they may be working on. Once a month, we will host
                a <b>workshop</b> where a speaker will present a technology or topic
                relevant to FOSS.
                <br>
                <br>
                Our first club meeting for the Fall 2021 semester is still upcoming.
                Be sure to join our newsletter or look out for announcements on our
                website or discord!
